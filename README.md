Gauss-Mitek program for electronic structure calculations of 1-dimensional harmonically-trapped ultracold Fermi gases. Current functionality includes SCF and MP2 methods. Planned functionality is to use F12 explicitly-correlated Ansatz for the correlation energy calculations.

Input structure:
 * interaction parameter *g*
 * number of orbital basis set functions *nbas*
 * number of doubly-occupied orbitals *nocc*
 * number of basis set functions used in explicitly-correlated calculations *nprim*
 * non-linear parameter in the correlation factor *alpha*
